This is the repository I'll be using for small python projects
### Calculator with GUI
The graphical interface is made according to the guide. The calculator is capable of solving equations, inequalities and common calculations
### Hangman
A simple project for relaxation
### acmp
A collection of my favourite tasks from [acmp.ru](https://acmp.ru/)
### random_walk:
Inspired by the [power of WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=3d+random+walk%2C+10000+steps).  I will add to my [telegram bot](https://github.com/Gvb3a/wolfram_telegram_bot) in the future. For me it is a door to the world of simulations
